# Project Overview

## responsive-app

This application is built with React JS, Bootstrap 4.6, and Vite. It is designed to be responsive and features reusable components that manage their own Bootstrap classes. To achieve this, a reusable function was implemented based on previous experiences. This function automatically adds classes from `component.bootstrap.js` files to the current components and allows for adding specific classes from the import location of the component.

To run the app:

-npm  i
-npm run dev

## KendoApp

This application is created with ASP.NET Core 5.0, Kendo UI for jQuery, and Bootstrap 4.3. The application meets the test requirements, allowing a review and refresh of several .NET concepts and terms.
